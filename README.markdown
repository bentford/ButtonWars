# Button Wars

This is a proof of concept game to prove a few things:

a) that Core Animation is fast enough to make a game from

b) how the Chipmunk physics library can be integrated into UIKit or Core Animation at a low level


## How to play

* Currently only supports two players, so grab a friend.

* **IMPORTANT: Right swipe anywhere on the screen to change levels and use the level editor!!**



## Credits

The game idea, graphic design, and programming are all done by me.
